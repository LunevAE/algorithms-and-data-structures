# Algorithms and data structures
This repository contains examples of popular algorithms and data structures.

## Data Structures

A data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to
the data.

* [Queue](data-structures/myQueue)
* [Deque](data-structures/myDeque)

## Algorithms

An algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation
